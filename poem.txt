I AM A FISH
I find the other fish suspicious
One could call them fishy
I swim and swim around the bowl
My tail is getting itchy...
But if only I were a llama
I would not have this itchy tail
I could go OUTSIDE the bowl
Abandon my old fishy trail
I should just become A LLAMA...
But the llama that I know
Is not a very nice llama
He spits in my face
And is very mean
But my friend Horsie the BEAR is nice...
